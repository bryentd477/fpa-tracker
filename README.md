## Database

The SQLite database is stored in the `backend` folder as `fpa.db`. This is a single file that persists all data locally. No external database or hosting is required.

**Database Tables:**
- `fpas` - Main FPA records
- `approved_activities` - Activity tracking for approved FPAs
- `renewal_history` - Historical renewal dates

## Stopping the Server

- **Windows:** Close the terminal window, or press Ctrl+C
- **Mac/Linux:** Press Ctrl+C in the terminal

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 Already in Use
Edit `backend/server.js` and change `const PORT = 3000;` to a different port (e.g., 3001)

### Dependencies Installation Failed
1. Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Try again with: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

### Database Issues
Delete `backend/fpa.db` to reset the database and start fresh

### Can't Access from Android
- Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
- Disable any VPN/proxy on either device
- Check Windows Firewall allows Node.js (you may be prompted when first starting)

## Development

To run in development mode with hot-reloading:
```
npm run dev
```

This requires the `concurrently` package (included in devDependencies).

## Production Deployment

To build for production:
```
npm run build
```

This optimizes the React frontend for deployment.
